For the creative portion of my movie search app, I implemented a "See more like this option" in the context menu.  I had already implemented the context menu for "Add to Favorites" for the extra credit piece and decided to build off of this.  Once you find a movie you like enough to add to favorites, you probably want more like that.  I am using the recommendations part of TMDB https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-recommendations to search for movies like the title you selected. The top recommendations show up like in the original collection view, and you can add them to your favorites just like any other movie.  Some small features I added were a scroll view for the details page.  I wanted to have the full description of the movie for the user without sacrificing the size of the movie poster. This option allows for a big image and a longer description the user can scroll through. I also modified my add to favorites function to check if the title was already in favorites using the movie id before adding it.  That way you don't end up with a bunch of duplicates in your favorites list.
